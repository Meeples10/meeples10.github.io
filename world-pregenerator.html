            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>This datapack was created to generate very large worlds to be analyzed by <a href="https://github.com/Meeples10/MCResourceAnalyzer">MCResourceAnalyzer</a>. It can also be used to pregenerate a world for a server to reduce load when players travel away from the spawnpoint, or for any other use that might require a large number of chunks to be generated beforehand.</p>
            <p>While this datapack was inspired by <a href="https://www.bluecommander.net/world-loader.html">a similar project by BlueCommander</a>, it was created entirely from scratch and does not use any functions or other content from BlueCommander's work.</p>
            <p>The datapack has been tested using Minecraft 1.17.1 and 1.18.</p>
            <p>If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to <a href="mailto:mc.meeples10@gmail.com">contact me</a>.</p>

            <h2 id="how-to">How to use the datapack</h2>
            <h3>Installation</h3>
            <p>To add the datapack to a new world during world creation, click the <strong>Data Packs</strong> button, then the <strong>Open Pack Folder</strong> button, and copy the datapack into the folder.</p>
            <p>If you would like to add the datapack to an existing world, simply copy the datapack into your world's <code class="inline">datapacks</code> folder (<code class="inline">.minecraft/saves/[name]/datapacks</code>).</p>
            <h3>After installation</h3>
            <p>If the datapack has been installed correctly, a chat message should appear when joining the world (if the pack was added on world creation) or after using the <code class="inline">/reload</code> command (if the pack was added to an existing world). If no message appeared in chat, run the following command: <code class="inline">/function wpg:init</code></p>
            <p>The datapack can be operated either using the aforementioned chat message or using functions. The available functions are as follows:</p>
            <table>
                <tr><td><code class="inline">/function wpg:init</code></td><td>If the datapack failed to be initialized automatically, use this to initialize it manually.</td></tr>
                <tr><td><code class="inline">/function wpg:start</code></td><td>Start the world pregeneration process.</td></tr>
                <tr><td><code class="inline">/function wpg:reset</code></td><td>Stop the world pregeneration process and reset its progress.</td></tr>
                <tr><td><code class="inline">/function wpg:uninstall</code>&nbsp;</td><td>Remove the datapack's scoreboard objective. The datapack must be removed from the world's <code class="inline">datapacks</code> folder in order to fully uninstall it.</td></tr>
            </table>
